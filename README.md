# Go+Svelte boilerplate

**early work in progress, some stuff are still not ok**

_...and many more fun things_

So. You want to create a fullstack project. good to go!
This is a template, feel free to use for almost everything (except Nazi and Terrorist stuff this is not allowed sorry.).

What is included in this boilerplate:

- Go (obviously)
- Svelte (still obvious)
- Gin Gonic (my bestie http framework for go)
- Vite (...fait,bien fait!)
- Tailwind (utility first ‚úåÔ∏è)
- DaisyUI (awesome tailwind components and themes ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- svelte-navigator (kiss üíã principle)
- viper for config
- logrus for logs
- Docker stuff for build and deploy

What is **not** included: 
- Sveltekit
- Typescript (unless you wanna try, but I didn't)
- Hate
- Chocolate
- Refunds if not what you expected

# Getting started (FINALLY!)

- Create a copy of this project
  - how?
    - download a tarball of it ([let me do it for you](https://github.com/decima/svelte-go-boilerplate/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
    - or...
    - use the "templating" feature from github ([let me do it for you](https://github.com/decima/svelte-go-boilerplate/generate))
- create a config.yaml file empty at root of the folder (it will be populated at first launch with defaults)
- There is a script named `rename.sh` **not working**, it is used to replace "BOILERPLATE" in every strings by the name you decide. Be careful to name it well (there's no turning back)
  - run `chmod a+x rename.sh && ./rename.sh`
  - you can either search and replace while the script is not working.

So you have a fresh project how to work with it ? 

First, run (and don't close it):
```
go run .
```
which will start the backend application.

Then go to app folder and launch the app.

```bash
cd app
yarn #or npm install, i'm not racist
yarn dev # or npm run dev, your problems :) 
```
The second command will print you an url. 
If everything's cool, you should have a beautiful example page.

the API is available on /api. 

## Build for production

I recommend docker, because it's a 3-stage build : 
- first for the frontend
- second for the backend
- and then a grouping build on an alpine instance.

you can try at any moment the app with : 
```
docker compose up --build
```
which exposes port 9000.
